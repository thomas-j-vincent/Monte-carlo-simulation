# Monte-carlo-simulation

The Monte-carlo simulation is a method of predicting outcomes using random numbers by running numerous simulations and taking a mean of the results, the main concept being using randomness to solve deterministic problems(problems where no randomness is involved). It is used to "brute-force" solutions to problems too complex to solve via mathematical analysis, under the topics; optimisation, numerical integration and probability distribution such as the number of Pi. Another usecase is to determine the risk of a strategy, such as trading or gambling as the monte carlo simulation can run through many possible outcomes and calculate the probability of one being the outcome that you want.

## Brief

In this Monte-carlo simulation we will attempt to find the "best" gambling strategy, with the highest profit percentage whilst also having the lowest bust rate (where a player loses all their money). In this scenario the player rolls a metaphorical dice with a possible outcome of 1-100, where if the number was 51-99 the player wins. This gives the player a roughly 49% chance of winning.
